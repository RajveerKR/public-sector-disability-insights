# public-sector-disability-insights

## Overview
This is a small, self-directed data insights project using publicly available disability data published by Stats NZ and referenced through Whaikaha – Ministry of Disabled People.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how descriptive analysis and accessible data storytelling can be used to support understanding of disability-related population patterns in Aotearoa New Zealand, while applying an ethical and equity-focused approach to public-sector data use.

## Data source
- **Source:** Stats NZ – Disability Statistics 2023 (Household Disability Survey)
- **Access:** Publicly available, aggregated data
- **Coverage:** Disability prevalence by age group for people living in households

No individual-level or confidential data is used in this project.

## Scope of analysis
The analysis focuses on **high-level age groups only**:
- Children (0–14 years)
- Adults (15 years and over)
- 15–44 years
- 45–64 years
- 65+ years

Other demographic breakdowns available in the source data (such as gender, ethnicity, and region) were intentionally excluded to keep the analysis descriptive and to minimise interpretive and ethical risk in a small self-directed project.

## Tools used
- Microsoft Excel (data extraction and preparation)
- Power BI (visualisation and insight communication)

## Outputs
- Clean analysis dataset (Excel)
- One-page Power BI dashboard showing disability prevalence by age group (2023)

## Ethics and limitations
This project uses publicly available, aggregated data. Findings are descriptive and intended to support high-level understanding rather than explain causes or represent individual experiences. Disability is diverse, and lived experience cannot be fully captured through quantitative data alone.

## Purpose
This project was completed to strengthen understanding of disability-related evidence and inclusive data storytelling in a public-sector context, and to demonstrate readiness for data and insights roles supporting Whaikaha and broader government decision-making.
